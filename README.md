# mit-64400-project
A project done for MIT's Fall 2023 6.4400 Computer Graphics class. The project focuses on Procedural Hilly City Generation with Perlin Noise &amp; L-Systems.

The project uses the method of ray casting for rendering a hilly city scene that is procedurally randomly generated using Perlin Noise and L-Systems. All code for the project was written from scratch, using algorithms learned in the class.

The final project report for the project can be found in the repo. Final product images generated for the project can also be found in the repo.
